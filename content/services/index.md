				<h1>Branding &amp; Identity</h1>
				<p>We've discovered that audiences tend to do business with brands based on one of three levels; price, product or purpose. We believe in building purpose-driven brands. Your price and product will change as you grow, but your purpose should never change.</p>
				<p>We've managed to simplify the branding process to make it easier for our clients' to understand, appreciate and follow along, while still delivering maximum impact. From the process, a strategy emerges that a brand can be built upon. From there we can design out the visual and tonal manifestation of that strategy, such as the logo, typefaces, icons and tone-of-voice, as well as a style guide to help your team manage your brand well.</p>

				<h1>Print</h1>
				<p>Because we live in a real world and your brand cannot exist in digital form alone.  Print is still very much alive and still offers great opportunities for your audience to connect with your brand.</p>
				<p>We can design the big stuff, such as ads, packaging and signage, as well as the small things such as business cards and stationary.</p>

				<h1>Web</h1>
				<p>Your online presence is probably your biggest touch-point, and your brand emotion needs be reflected in the experience. Whether your audience is interacting with you online via desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile, their experience should be easy-to-use, positive and memorable.</p>
				<p>Besides that, it also needs to meet your business goals.  We like to ask, "If your website was an employee, what would you want it to do for you?".  The answer to that question will give us a good idea of where to start.
